# Behind the scenes: Dev edition - Dev Retro 2022

Hello there, today we'll be taking a look at my journey in the field of software engineering. In this article, I'll go over the highlights of my journey from newbie developer to where I am now. I'll discuss my key milestones, technologies I've learned, challenges I've faced, and valuable lessons I've learned along the way. I'll also be showcasing some of my most notable projects and discussing my future development goals.

<summary>Towards the end of December 2020: where it all started</summary>
<p>This was three months after I completed my A-levels at FUTA (the uni I wanted to get into). I came across a flier for TITA coding Bootcamp at a time when I had decided to learn a skill while waiting for admission to FUTA. I decided I wanted to learn about programming but didn

<p>After the Bootcamp, I kept building with what I had learned and kept learning new concepts, technologies, and programming languages as time passed. I didn

<p>Started hunting for my first freelance gig and got it just after two weeks. Resumed 200lv in FUTA to study computer science around this time too.</p>

<p>After a difficult period after quitting my job at Gtext soft, I continued to upskill, expand my network and build my personal project. I worked at 3 different companies within this time period the last one being the one I am still currently in. I worked as a frontend developer in one of them which was an early-stage startup and a backend developer (which is my preferred role) in the rest. I learned a lot about working with a team, setting and meeting up with milestones, the importance of communication in the teams I have worked with, and so on.</p>

## Technologies I've learnt so far

* HTML and CSS: These are the building blocks of the web and are essential for anyone looking to become a web developer.
    
* JavaScript: This is a versatile language that powers many of the interactive features on the web. I've used it to build everything from simple forms to full-blown web apps.
    
* Python: This is a popular language for data analysis and machine learning. I mostly used it to build web scrappers and small scripts.
    
* SQL: This is a language for working with databases. I mostly use relational database so it's a must have.
    
* NestJs: A typescript nodejs framework used to build backends. This is daily driver for building backend applications at the moment.
    
* Golang: A programming language built by google with the aim of simplicity. I learnt this out of curiosity.
    
* MISC: This are other tools I learnt such as git, docker, postman, swagger and so on. There other libraries I learnt as well be there are so many I am not gonna list them here.
    

## Roadblocks I faced along the way

Like any journey, my path to becoming a developer has had its fair share of challenges and roadblocks. One of the biggest challenges I faced early on was my equipment, particularly my laptop during my early stages which gave me so many issues while learning and even after I got my first freelance gig. I lost a lot of gigs because of this and it affected my productivity a lot, I am glad I was able to overcome this after getting a much more powerful computer.

Another challenge I faced was taking on too many projects at once, this affected me a lot and make me burn out a lot quicker. I had to even forfeit a ton of projects so I could actually complete things. It is still something I deal with but I have learned to be better.

## Lessons I have learned so far

If I have learned anything so far during the past 2 years is that there's nothing special about programming, anyone can learn anything and if you put in the work in the right places then you will see results.


## Moving forward

It's been a fun 2 years, there were highs and lows. I learned a lot and made a lot of mistakes but I am grateful for everything. I am not changing much moving forward (at the moment at least), I will continue learning and prioritizing my competence. The only few things I would be changing are the volume at which I push content, contribute to open source, and do community work. I want to do more of that, I want to impact others, grow my income and become a top-level software engineer. "The best time was 2 years ago the second best time is now".
